% Abstract
    \nonumchap{Abstract}
Blending is a recent seismic acquisition design which allows seismic shots to interfere. Blending is beneficial in terms of data quality and acquisition costs. Current processing techniques are not capable to deal with blended data. Consequently, the blended data must be separated as if they were acquired in a conventional way. The separation technique is referred to as deblending.

This thesis reviews the 2D deblending method of \citet{Mahdad-Deblending-Method}, which is a noise prediction and subtraction method. Thus, this thesis points out how deblending benefits from incoherent shot interference, or "blending noise". In this context a new measure of incoherency is introduced and 3 incoherent blending patterns are proposed. Synthetic 2D data are blended with different incoherent blending patterns to analyze the effect of incoherency on the deblending quality.

Based on the 2D method of \citet{Mahdad-Deblending-Method} a 3D deblending method is derived. The key differences between the 2D and 3D methods are the data sorting and the coherency filter. Next, the presented method is tested on a field data set. The field data results demonstrate that the method successfully deblends strong interfering events. The deblending of weak late events is not optimal yet.

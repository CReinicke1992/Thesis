% Abstract
    \nonumchap{Abstract}
Blending is a recent seismic acquisition design, which allows seismic shots to interfere. %Blending is beneficial in terms of data quality and acquisition costs. 
Current processing techniques are not capable to deal with blended data. Consequently, the blended data must be deblended (separated) as if they were acquired in a conventional way.

I propose a new acquisition design, blended crossline-sources. In contrast to existing blended acquisition designs, that only blend in 2D (inline direction and time), this design blends sources in 3D (inline direction, crossline direction and time). Blended crossline-sources allow to increase the data quality, and/or to reduce the acquisition costs. 

While most blended acquisition designs blend 2 sources, the proposed acquisition design has to blend up to 7 sources. In order to realize this increase in number of blended sources without degrading the data quality the blended acquisition design and the deblending method must be improved.

To enhance the blending, I introduce a new incoherency measure of the blended acquisition design, and propose 3 incoherent blending patterns. A 2D synthetic data example illustrated that the deblending quality indeed is optimized by maximizing the incoherency of the blended acquisition.

To enhance the deblending, I derive a 3D deblending method. In contrast to 2D deblending methods, this method exploits both the crossline and inline direction to deblend sources. The 3D deblending method significantly increases the deblending quality as illustrated by a 3D synthetic data example.

The feasibility of blended crossline-sources was proven on a 3D complex synthetic dataset. Two acquisition configurations were examined: The \textit{Wide Crossline Source Array} aims to reduce the acquisition costs, and the \textit{Dense Crossline Source Array} increases the data quality. Both of them provided excellent deblending results with quality factors of \SI{14.2}{\decibel} and \SI{20.8}{\decibel} respectively.

%This thesis reviews the 2D deblending method of \citet{Mahdad-Deblending-Method}, which is a noise prediction and subtraction method. Thus, it is demonstrated how deblending benefits from incoherent shot interference, so-called blending noise. In this context a new measure of incoherency is introduced, and 3 possibilities of incoherent blending are proposed. The effect of incoherency on the deblending quality is analyzed at the example of 2D synthetic data. The results suggest that optimal deblending quality is achieved by maximizing the incoherency of the blended acquisition.

%Based on the 2D method of \citet{Mahdad-Deblending-Method} a 3D deblending method is derived. The key differences between the 2D and 3D methods are; (1) the data sorting, and (2) the coherency filter. Next, the presented method is tested on a complex synthetic data set. The results demonstrate that the method successfully deblends strong interfering events. The deblending of weak late events is not optimal yet. 

%In total, the results indicate that blended crossline-sources is a potential acquisition design. With some further development blended crossline-sources is promising to become feasible as a standard acquisition design.

% Abstract
    \nonumchap{Abstract}
Blending is a recent seismic acquisition design which allows seismic shots to interfere. Blending is beneficial in terms of data quality and acquisition costs. Current processing techniques are not capable to deal with blended data. Consequently, the blended data must be separated as if they were acquired in a conventional way. The separation technique is referred to as deblending.

This thesis reviews the 2D deblending method of \citet{Mahdad-Deblending-Method}, which is a noise prediction and subtraction method. Thus, this thesis points out how deblending benefits from incoherent shot interference, or "blending noise". In this context a new measure of incoherency is introduced, and 3 incoherent blending patterns are proposed. The effect of incoherency on the deblending quality is analyzed at the example of 2D synthetic 2D data. The results suggest that optimal deblending quality is achieved by maximizing the incoherency of the blending pattern.

Based on the 2D method of \citet{Mahdad-Deblending-Method} a 3D deblending method is derived. The key differences between the 2D and 3D methods are the data sorting and the coherency filter. Next, the presented method is tested on a field data set. The field data results demonstrate that the method successfully deblends strong interfering events. The deblending of weak late events is not optimal yet. 

In total, the results indicate that 3D crossline blending is a potential acquisition design. Before applying it in practice further development should be done.

\section{Blending pattern}


\begin{itemize}
	\item Explain how the acquisition limits the firing pattern
	\item Introduce spatial incoherency
	\item Suggest the applied blending pattern
	\item Show quality factor versus incoherency/firing pattern
\end{itemize}

The blending pattern is an important control factor of the deblending performance. Section \ref{sec:BlendingMatrix} showed that incoherent blending is favorable for a good deblending result. Thus, different incoherent blending patterns are tested. Due to the acquisition design (see Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-3D-BlendedAcquisition}) the blending pattern underlies some limits. For example, the sources within one crossline must be blended before the vessel reaches the next inline position.

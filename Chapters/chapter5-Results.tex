\chapter{Results}

This chapter presents the major results of this thesis. First, an optimal blending pattern for simultaneous crossline sources will be derived. Then, the advantages of a 3D $f$-$k_x$-$k_y$-filter towards a 2D $f$-$k$-filter will be shown. Finally, the feasibility of the suggested acquisition design will be proven on a synthetic 3D data set.

An incoherent blending pattern is crucial for good deblending performance (see section \ref{sec:BlendingMatrix}). Thus, a measure of incoherency and deblending quality will be introduced. Then, the effect of incoherency and of the maximum firing time delay on the deblending performance will be demonstrated.

\subsection*{Incoherency Measure}

In this thesis only the incoherency of the acquisition design is considered. Thus, the blending matrix, $\Gamma$, determines the incoherency. In section \ref{sec:BlendingMatrix} it was shown that for an incoherent blending pattern the elements, $\mathrm{e}^{-j \omega \Delta t_{kl}}$, along a sub-diagonal of the product $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma}^H$ should be out of phase. 

These sub-diagonal elements, $\mathrm{e}^{-j \omega \Delta t_{kl}}$, are complex numbers with unit length and variable phase. Hence, the elements are located in the complex plane on a circle with radius 1 (see Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Results-complex-circle}). 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 0.5\textwidth]{Plots/complex-circle}
	\caption{Illustration of the sub-diagonal elements in the complex number plane. The elements have unit length and variable phase. The absolute value of their sum depends on the phase coherency of the elements.}
	\label{fig:Ch-Results-complex-circle}
\end{figure}


If all elements are in phase the length of their sum is maximized. The more the elements are out of phase, i.e. the more incoherent they are, the smaller is the length of the summed elements. Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Results-Diagonal-Sums} illustrates the length of the summed sub-diagonals. The elements on the main diagonal of the product $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma}^H$ are all equal to 1. Thus, the spike in Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Results-Diagonal-Sums} refers to the main diagonal of $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma}^H$. For a perfectly incoherent blending design the elements on a sub-diagonal cancel and the plot becomes a perfect spike. 


\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Plots/diagonal-sums}
	\caption{The sub-diagonal elements, $\mathrm{e}^{-j \omega \Delta t_{kl}}$, of the product $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma}^H$ are summed. The length of each output is plotted as a function of the diagonal. The spike is caused by the main diagonal elements of $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma}^H$ because they are all in phase.}
	\label{fig:Ch-Results-Diagonal-Sums}
\end{figure}

The incoherency, $\mu$, is quantified as follows: The elements are summed along sub-diagonals of $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma}^H$. Each sum is taken in absolute terms and squared;

\begin{equation}
	\left| \sum \mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma}^H_{ii} (\omega) \right|^2.
	\label{eq:Ch-Results-incoherency-diagsum}	
\end{equation}

This gives one value per sub-diagonal and per frequency component, $\omega$. These values are summed over all sub-diagonals;
 
 \begin{equation}
 	\sum_{i = 1-N_s}^{N_s-1}	 \left( \left| \sum \mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma}^H_{ii} (\omega) \right|^2 \right);
 	\label{eq:Ch-Results-incoherency-srcsum}
 \end{equation}
 
and over all frequencies, $\omega$;

\begin{equation}
	\sum_{\omega} \left( \sum_{i = 1-N_s}^{N_s-1}	 \left( \left| \sum \mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma}^H_{ii} (\omega) \right|^2 \right) \right).
	\label{eq:Ch-Results-incoherency-wsum}
\end{equation}

 The output value measures the total coherent energy in the matrix $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma}^H$. The same calculation is performed for the main diagonal only;
 
 \begin{equation}
 	\sum_{\omega} \left( \left| \sum \mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma}^H_{00} (\omega) \right|^2  \right).
 	\label{eq:Ch-Results-incoherency-maindiag}
 \end{equation} 

 The incoherency is defined in this thesis as the ratio of the coherent energy on the main diagonal of $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma}^H$ (see equation \ref{eq:Ch-Results-incoherency-maindiag}) and the total coherent energy of $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma}^H$ (see equation \ref{eq:Ch-Results-incoherency-wsum});

\begin{equation}
	\mu = \frac{  \sum_{\omega} \left( \left| \sum \mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma}^H_{00} (\omega) \right|^2  \right)  }{  \sum_{\omega} \left( \sum_{i = 1-N_s}^{N_s-1}	 \left( \left| \sum \mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma}^H_{ii} (\omega) \right|^2 \right) \right)  }.
	\label{eq:Ch-Results-incoherency}
\end{equation}

Note that in equation \ref{eq:Ch-Results-incoherency} $N_s$ is the number of sources.

For example, a perfectly incoherent blending pattern has coherent energy only on the main diagonal. Thus, the nominator and the denominator in equation \ref{eq:Ch-Results-incoherency} are identical. The incoherency equals 1. Instead a perfectly coherent blending pattern, e.g. all sources are fired simultaneously, has an even distribution of coherent energy across the matrix $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma}^H$. Consequently, the incoherency is nearly 0.



\subsection*{Deblending Performance Measure}

The following data examples are synthetic data, i.e. the unblended data is known. Therefore, the deblending performance can be measured with the quality factor, $Q$, which is defined by \citet{IbrahimQuality} as;

\begin{equation}
	Q = 10 \cdot \frac{\left|\left|\text{Unblended data}\right|\right| _2 ^2}{\left|\left|\text{Unblended data - Deblended data}\right|\right| _2 ^2} \;.	
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Incoherency Effect}

This thesis considers the following blended acquisition set up: The sources are assembled in crossline direction and move in inline direction due to the vessel movement (see Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-3D-BlendedAcquisition}). As a consequence each experiment can blend sources which belong to the same crossline. The inline source sampling rate must be sufficiently small to avoid spatial aliasing. Thus, the sources within one crossline must be blended and recorded before the vessel reaches the next inline position.

Based on this set up there are three possibilities to blend the sources incoherently. First, the sources can be blended with random time delays (temporal incoherency). Second, one can randomly pick sources for each experiment (spatial incoherency). Third, temporal and spatial incoherency can be combined, i.e. randomly picked sources are blended with random time delays.

In the following these blending patterns will applied to a synthetic data set (see Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Results-Unbl-Delphi}, \ref{fig:Ch-Results-Unbl-inline10}, \ref{fig:Ch-Results-Unbl-xline10}). Next, the data is deblended with the 3D deblending algorithm of chapter \ref{chap:MahdadMethod3d}. 

The deblending results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Results-Debl-Delphi} and \ref{fig:Ch-Results-Debl-x-inline}. The results suggest that only spatial incoherency is not sufficient to deblend the data (see Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Results-Debl-Delphi-x}, \ref{fig:Ch-Results-Debl-inline10-x}, \ref{fig:Ch-Results-Debl-xline10-x}). By introducing random firing time delays the deblended data improves significantly as shown in Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Results-Debl-Delphi-t}, \ref{fig:Ch-Results-Debl-inline10-t}, \ref{fig:Ch-Results-Debl-xline10-t}). A combination of both spatial and temporal incoherency enhances the deblended data further (see Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Results-Debl-Delphi-xt}, \ref{fig:Ch-Results-Debl-inline10-xt}, \ref{fig:Ch-Results-Debl-xline10-xt}).

\end{figure}

The deblending performance is quantified with a quality factor, $Q$, which is defined by \citet{IbrahimQuality} as;

\begin{equation}
	Q = 10 \cdot \frac{\left|\left|\text{Unblended data}\right|\right| _2 ^2}{\left|\left|\text{Unblended data - Deblended data}\right|\right| _2 ^2} .	
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Results-QualityFactors} illustrates the quality factor for the 3 blending patterns as a function of the maximum firing time delay. The plot confirms the previous observations: Only spatial incoherency limits the deblended data quality, whereas temporal incoherency allows to achieve significantly better deblending performance. The combination of spatial and temporal incoherency can even enhance the result further.

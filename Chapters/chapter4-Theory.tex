\chapter{Theory} \label{chap:theory}

This chapter describes the theory behind blending and deblending. First the detail hiding operator notation is explained. This notation is used to describe the forward model of seismic data. By introducing the blending operator the forward model is extended to the blended case. Next, the deblending method of \citet{Mahdad-Deblending-Method} is discussed to illustrate the concepts on which this thesis is based. At the end of the chapter the blending operator is analyzed in greater detail, and the extension to 3D is discussed.

\section{The Forward Model of Blending} \label{sec:Ch-Theory-Operator}
%The detail hiding operator notation was introduced by \citet{Berkhout1982}, and later on it was extended for blended data. 

\subsection{Conventional Seismic Data}
In the detail hiding operator notation \citep{Berkhout1982} the recorded signal is considered discrete in terms of time $t$, receiver position $x_r$, and source position $x_s$. Thus, the measurements can be organized in a cube, $\mathbf{p(t,x_r,x_s)}$ (see Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-DataMatrix}). Each frequency slice of this new cube represents the data matrix, $\mathbf{P}$. 

In the data matrix, $\mathbf{P}$, each column corresponds to a monochromatic common shot gather, each row to a monochromatic common receiver gather, each diagonal to a monochromatic common offset gather, and each anti-diagonal to a monochromatic common midpoint gather. These properties are summarized in Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-DataMatrixMahdad}. 

\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics{Plots/P-Groenestijn_2010}
	\caption{Illustration of the data matrix, $\mathbf{P}$, by \citet{Groenestijn_2010}. \textit{Left:} The signal generated at the source position, $x_s$, is measured at receiver position, $x_r$, as a function of time, $t$. Thus, the discretized data is saved in a cube, $\mathbf{p(t,x_r,x_s)}$. \textit{Right:} The cube on the right equals the left cube after a Fourier transform with respect to time. Each frequency slice of the right cube represents the data matrix, $\mathbf{P}$.}

\end{figure}

	\includegraphics[width = 0.6\textwidth]{Plots/Mahdad-Data-Matrix-edited}
	\caption{Illustration of the data matrix, $\mathbf{P}$, by \cite{Mahdad-Deblending-Method}. The dotted lines indicate directions of common gathers.}
	\label{fig:Ch-Theory-DataMatrixMahdad}
\end{figure}

Based on the seismic forward model of \citet{Berkhout1982} the data matrix, $\mathbf{P}$, can be represented by a matrix multiplication of the source matrix, $\mathbf{S}$, the impulse response of the Earth, $\mathbf{X}$, and the receiver matrix, $\mathbf{D}$:

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{D \, X \, S}.
	\label{eq:Ch-Theory-DataRepresentation}
\end{equation}

In the source matrix, $\mathbf{S}$, each row and each column represent one source position (see Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-BlendedSource}). Thus, $\mathbf{S}$ is a diagonal matrix. $\mathbf{S}$ captures one frequency component of the source signature. By applying a Fourier transform to all frequency components the source signature is obtained.

 The impulse response of the Earth, $\mathbf{X}$, describes how an impulse at the source location, $x_s$, is transformed in the Earth into the signal at the receiver location, $x_r$.

$\mathbf{D}$ is the receiver matrix, which converts the seismic wavefield at the receiver location $x_r$ to the recorded signal.

In practice, one tries to retrieve the unknown Earth response, $\mathbf{X}$, from the data, $\mathbf{P}$, by removing $\mathbf{S}$ (designature) and $\mathbf{D}$ (receiver deghosting).

\subsection{Blended Seismic Data}

For blended acquisition the recorded events belonging to different sources overlap as shown in the shot gather in Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-BlendedData}. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{Plots/Mahdad/30iter/BlendedCSG_sh1-edit_copy}
	\caption{Common shot gather of two blended shots with a time delay of about \SI{120}{\milli\second}.}
	\label{fig:Ch-Theory-BlendedData}
\end{figure}

This can be captured in the forward model by introducing a blending matrix, $\mathbf{\Gamma}$, which transforms the source matrix, $\mathbf{S}$, into a blended source matrix, $\mathbf{S_{bl}}$,

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{S_{bl}} = \mathbf{S \, \Gamma}.
	\label{eq:Ch-Theory-BlendedSource}
\end{equation}

 Each row of $\mathbf{\Gamma}$ represents one source, and each column of $\mathbf{\Gamma}$ represents one experiment (see Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-BlendedSource}). 
 
 The blending matrix captures the physics of a blended acquisition as follows: An element $\gamma_{ij}$ of the blending matrix relates a source $i$ to an experiment $j$. Within the experiment $j$ the source $i$ has a relative amplitude $A_{ij}$ and a relative time delay $t_{ij}$ with respect to the first source fired in the $j^{th}$ experiment. If the source $i$ is not fired in the $j^{th}$ experiment the amplitude $A_{ij}$ is zero. Based on these considerations the element $\gamma_{ij}$ is described with an amplitude term $A_{ij}$ and a phase term $\mathrm{e}^{-j \omega \Delta t_{ij}}$; 

\begin{equation}
	\gamma_{ij} =  A_{ij} \mathrm{e}^{-j \omega \Delta t_{ij}}.
	\label{eq:Ch-Theory-BlendingElement}
\end{equation} 

Thus, the blending matrix selects specific sources from the source matrix and superimposes as visualized in Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-BlendedSource}. From Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-BlendedSource} it also becomes clear that both the blending matrix, $\mathbf{\Gamma}$, and the blended source matrix, $\mathbf{S_{bl}}$, have more rows than columns.

(c) Illustration of blended acquisition with two vessels and the source matrix $\mathbf{S_{bl}}$. The experiment number is indicated on top of each drawing.}
	\label{fig:Ch-Theory-BlendedSource}
	
\end{figure}

In the case of source blending the receiver matrix, $\mathbf{D}$, is not influenced by blending. And of course, the Earth impulse response, $\mathbf{X}$, is independent of the acquisition design. Hence, the blended data can be written as;

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{P_{bl}} = \mathbf{D} \, \mathbf{X} \, \mathbf{S_{bl}} = \mathbf{D} \, \mathbf{X} \, \mathbf{S} \, \mathbf{\Gamma} = \mathbf{P \, \Gamma}.
	\label{eq:Ch-Theory-BlendedData}
\end{equation}

Note that the blended data matrix, $\mathbf{P_{bl}}$, has less columns, i.e. less experiments, than the unblended data matrix, $\mathbf{P}$.



\section{Deblending} \label{sec:MahdadMethod}

The deblending method in this thesis builds on the method of \citet{Mahdad-Deblending-Method}. Therefore, the method of \citet{Mahdad-Deblending-Method} is described in detail. In section \ref{sec:MahdadMethod3d} it will be extended to 3D.


The basic workflow of the method of \citet{Mahdad-Deblending-Method} is summarized in Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-FlowChart} and will be explained step by step in the following subsections. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Plots/Mahdad-FlowChart-v3}
	\caption{Pseudo-deblending provides a first estimate of the unblended data. The blended sources are incoherent in the common receiver domain. This incoherent blending noise is attenuated with f-k-filtering and thresholding. Next, the source interference is estimated and subtracted from the pseudo-deblended data. The deblended data is achieved when the data estimation converges.}
	\label{fig:Ch-Theory-FlowChart}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Pseudo-Deblending}
Unfortunately, the inverse problem of equation \ref{eq:Ch-Theory-BlendedData} is underdetermined, which means that there is not a unique solution for the unblended data, $\mathbf{P}$. Thus, additional constraints are required to deblend the data, which are sparsity of the signal in the $x$-$t$-domain and coherency of the signal in the $f$-$k$-domain. 

The first guess of the unblended data matrix, $\mathbf{P}$, is estimated via pseudo-deblending;

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{P_{ps}} = \mathbf{P_{bl}} \, \mathbf{\Gamma^H}.
	\label{eq:Ch-Theory-PseudoDeblended}
\end{equation}

Pseudo-deblending copies the blended data to the locations of all shots present in the blended shot and shifts it  upward to compensate for the time delay of the blended source. For example, Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-PseudoDeblendedCSG} shows the pseudo-deblended shot gather of the blended data in Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-BlendedData}.


\subsection{Common Receiver Gather}By transforming the data to another domain, e.g. to the common receiver domain, the interfering sources become incoherent and are visible as spiky noise (see Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-PseudoDeblendedCRG}). Therefore, the interfering sources can be attenuated with a noise filter. The noise generated by the interfering sources is called blending noise. 
\todo[inline]{Considering the 1/b factor, the interfering source creates blending noise and scales the amplitude of the shot of interest. So, is it correct to set blending noise and interfering source equal?}

	\caption{Pseudo-deblended data, $\mathbf{P_{ps}}$, sorted in a common shot gather (left) and common receiver gather (right). The overlapping sources map in the pseudo-deblended shot gather as coherent events, while they map as incoherent spikes in the pseudo-deblended receiver gather.}
	\label{fig:Ch-Theory-PseudoDeblended}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Iterative Blending Noise Estimation}

Note that all the quantities which are estimated are indicated with a hat. The steps of the iterative blending noise estimation are demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-IterativeDeblending}.

\subsubsection*{F-K-Filtering}
In an ideal case the blending noise, $\mathbf{N}$, which overlies the signal in the pseudo-deblended data would be calculated based on the unblended data,

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{N} = \mathbf{P_{bl}} \, \mathbf{\Gamma^H} - \mathbf{P}.
	\label{eq:Ch-Theory-Noise}
\end{equation}

Obviously, in practice the unblended data is unknown and must be estimated by adding extra constraints. One of these constraints is coherency, i.e. by assuming the blending noise in Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-PseudoDeblendedCRG} is incoherent it can be removed. For this purpose the data is transformed from the space time to the wavenumber frequency domain where the spiky noise spreads over all frequency and wavenumber components (see Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-FKDeblended-NoFilter}, top). 


For a 2D $f$-$k$-spectrum the minimum (physical) velocity of the subsurface, $v_{min}$, determines the maximum unaliased wavenumber, $k_{max}$,  for a given frequency, $f$;

\begin{equation}
	k_{max} = \frac{f}{v_{min}}.
	\label{eq_Ch-Theory-MaxWavenmber}
\end{equation} 

For each frequency, $f$, wavenumbers above $k_{max}$ are removed which results in a 2D signal cone as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-FK-Mask}.

\todo[inline]{Revise the discussion about the fk cone. kmax also depends on the spatial sampling rate! I think usually the spatial sampling rate should be chosen such that he highest frequency of interest can be recorded unaliased. $kmax = \frac{1}{2 \Delta x}$, $f_{max} = k_{max} v_{min}$.}

$f$-$k$-filtering removes the part of the blending noise, which maps outside of the signal cone. Thus, the amplitudes of the spiky noise in space time domain are attenuated (see Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-FKFiltered}). 

Note that $f$-$k$-filtering can only reduce unaliased frequency components of the blending noise. In Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-FK-Mask} the highest unaliased frequency is defined by the point where the white cone intersects with the frequency axis, i.e. at \SI{60}{\hertz}.

	\label{fig:Ch-Theory-EstimatedData}

\end{figure}



\subsubsection*{Thresholding}
The second constraint for the estimation of the unblended data is sparsity in the space time domain.

After $f$-$k$-filtering the spiky noise is attenuated (see Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-FKFiltered}). Next, one defines a threshold in the $x$-$t$ domain, which is larger than the noise amplitudes and smaller than the highest signal amplitudes. Only amplitudes above the threshold are picked, i.e. only signal with strong amplitudes is selected (see Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-Threshold}). 

The resulting thresholded data, \textbf{\={P}}, is used to predict the source interference;

\begin{equation}
	\textbf{\^{N}}_\textbf{i} = \textbf{\={P}} \, (\mathbf{\Gamma \, \Gamma^H} - \textbf{I}),
	\label{eq:Ch-Theory-NoiseEstimation}
\end{equation}

which is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-Noise}.

At each iteration the blending noise is attenuated further, such that the threshold can be lowered. Hence, the predicted source interference increases and approaches the true source interference. 

 Thresholding allows to reduce aliased frequency components of the blending noise.

\subsubsection*{Blending Noise Subtraction} 
The estimate of the unblended data matrix \textbf{\^{P}}$_\textbf{i}$ is updated by subtracting the noise from the pseudo-deblended data,

\begin{equation}
	\textbf{\^P}_\textbf{i+1} = \textbf{P}_\textbf{bl} \, \mathbf{\Gamma^H} - \textbf{\^{N}}_\textbf{i}, 
	\label{eq:Ch-Theory-DataUpdate1}
\end{equation}

which is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-Deblended}.

This process is repeated iteratively till convergence is reached. In this context convergence can be defined as the point where the difference $\mid \textbf{\^P}_\textbf{i+1} - \textbf{\^{P}}_\textbf{i} \mid$ drops below a predefined limit. Alternatively, one can set a maximum number of iterations. 

Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-EstimatedData} shows the estimate of the unblended data for increasing iterations. One can observe that the blended shot is successively  attenuated.



\section{Analysis of the Blending Matrix} \label{sec:BlendingMatrix} blue

In order to optimize the blended acquisition design, one must understand the properties of the blending matrix $\mathbf{\Gamma}$ and its influence on the deblending performance.

The blending matrix $\mathbf{\Gamma}$ determines the pseudo-deblended data,

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{ P_{ps} } = \mathbf{P \Gamma \Gamma ^H},
	\label{eq:Ch-Theory-Pseudo-Deblended-Data}
\end{equation}

which is a superposition of the unblended data, $\mathbf{P}$, and the source interference, $\mathbf{N}$,

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{P_{ps}} = \mathbf{P} + \mathbf{N}.
	\label{eq:Ch-Theory-PseudoSuperposition}
\end{equation}

The more incoherent the source interference, $\mathbf{N}$, the better it can be removed by noise filters.

%If the matrix product $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma ^H}$ was an identity matrix the pseudo-deblended data would be equal to the unblended data, and therefore it would not require any further processing. However, an identity matrix implies that no sources are blended.

In the following the effect of the blending matrix, $\mathbf{\Gamma}$, on the product $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma^H}$ and on the pseudo-deblended data is analyzed. For simplicity it is assumed that the blending matrix, $\mathbf{\Gamma}$, only contains phase shift terms, $\mathrm{e}^{-j \omega \Delta t}$, with an amplitude equal to 1 or 0. Besides one assumes that each source is fired only once.

Each row of $\mathbf{\Gamma}$ represents a source $i$ and each column of $\mathbf{\Gamma ^H}$ represents a source $k$ with a complex conjugated phase term. Hence, each element $a_{ik}$ of the matrix $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma^H}$ is the dot product between the $i^{th}$ source and the complex conjugate of the $k^{th}$ source,


%For simplicity it is assumed that the blending matrix, $\mathbf{\Gamma}$, only contains phase shift terms, $\mathrm{e}^{-j \omega \Delta t}$, with an amplitude equal to 1 or 0. Then the product $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma ^H}$ can be written as, 

\begin{equation}

	\end{aligned}
	\label{eq:Ch-Theory-G-GH}
\end{equation}

 Consequently, an element $a_{ik}$ of the product $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma ^H}$ represents the overlap of the sources $i$ and $k$ for all experiments. The main diagonal of $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma ^H}$ refers to the overlap of each source with itself, which of course is perfect and therefore equal to 1. The off diagonal elements of $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma ^H}$ are either 0 if the associated sources do not overlap, or contain a phase shift, $\mathrm{e}^{\, -j \omega \Delta t_{ik}}$.

	\label{eq:Ch-Theory-GGH}
\end{equation}
	
\end{comment}

In equation \ref{eq:Ch-Theory-Pseudo-Deblended-Data} the main diagonal elements of $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma ^H}$ copy the data matrix, $\mathbf{P}$, while the off-diagonal elements create the source interference, $\mathbf{N}$. If the elements $a_{ik}$ along a lower or upper diagonal are in phase, they will shift the columns of the data matrix and apply a coherent phase shift to each of them. Instead if the elements $a_{ik}$ along a lower or upper diagonal are out of phase, they will shift the columns of the data matrix and distort the phase of each column. 

In order to generate incoherent source interference, $\mathbf{N}$, it is therefore favorable if the elements $a_{ik}$ of each lower or upper diagonal are out of phase. For example, considering the $n^{th}$ upper or lower diagonal of the matrix $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma^H}$ this observation translates to the acquisition as follows: All source pairs, which are $n$ sources apart from each other, must be fired incoherently. The incoherent firing is realized by delaying blended sources with a random time delay.

Intuitively, the degree of incoherency of the source interference, $\mathbf{N}$, also depends on whether the sources blended in an experiment are selected randomly, or in a spatially coherent pattern. For example, one expects the source interference to be more incoherent if in each experiment randomly picked sources are blended, than if in each experiment adjacent sources are blended.

In terms of the blending matrix $\mathbf{\Gamma}$ a spatially incoherent firing pattern means that the rows, i.e. the sources, are shuffled randomly. As a consequence the off-diagonal elements of the matrix product $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma^H}$ are reordered randomly. This shuffling process can help to further distort the phase of the interfering sources. However, if the maximum allowed time delay between blended sources is aready large the spatially incoherent blending pattern will not increase the incoherency of the interfering sources.   

In practice, the maximum allowed firing time delay is limited by the available acquisition time. The spatial distribution of blended sources is constraint by the acquisition design.

%Based on the above reasoning it is suggested to randomly pick sources from a crossline and blend them with a maximum firing delay time which is chosen in accordance with the vessel speed and the spatial inline sampling rate.

which will be referred to as sub-diagonals in this thesis. The sub-diagonals contain either phase shifts or zeros, and they generate the blending noise in the pseudo-deblended data. Thus, in order to design an acquisition set up which optimizes the pseudo-deblended data, one should take into account the effect of the sub-diagonals on the data.

Consider the example in Figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-Diagonal-Effect}: The $i^{th}$ element of the $k^{th}$ upper diagonal $d_{ik}$ scales the $i^{th}$ column of the data matrix $\mathbf{P_i}$ with a factor $d_{ik}$ and shifts this column by $k$ positions to the right:

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{P_i} \rightarrow d_{ik}\mathbf{P_{i+k}}.	
	\label{eq:Ch-Theory-UpperDiag}
\end{equation}

Analogously, the $i^{th}$ element of the $k^{th}$ lower diagonal $d_{ik}$ scales the $(i + k)^{th}$ column of the data matrix $\mathbf{P_{i + k}}$ with a factor $d_{ik}$ and shifts this column by $k$ positions to the left:

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{P_{i+k}} \rightarrow d_{ik}\mathbf{P_{i}}.

One can think of the product $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma ^H}$ as a superposition of  $(2*Ns-1)$ diagonal matrices, where each matrix contains one of the sub-diagonals of $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma ^H}$,

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma ^H} = \sum^{N_s-1}_{i=-\left(N_s-1\right)} \mathbf{diag\,_{i}}.
	\label{eq:Ch-Theory-GGH-Decom}
\end{equation}

Thus, the pseudo-deblended data can be written as,

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{P \Gamma \Gamma ^H} = \mathbf{P \, diag_{0}} + \mathbf{P \, diag_{1-N_s}} + \dots + \mathbf{P \, diag_{Ns-1}} = \mathbf{P} + \text{Blending Noise}.
	\label{eq:Ch-Theory-GGH-Pseudo}
\end{equation}

This shows that the main diagonal copies the unblended data, whereas the lower and upper diagonals create the blending noise. 

As the Mahdad deblending method is based on noise filtering the blending noise in equation \ref{eq:Ch-Theory-GGH-Pseudo} should be designed as incoherent as possible. 

First, all sub-diagonal elements of $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma ^H}$ shift the data $\mathbf{P}$ coherently to the left or right. If these sub-diagonal elements had the same phase, the shifted data would remain coherent and a noise filter could not remove the blending noise. However, if these sub-diagonal elements contain random phase shifts the traces of shifted data are delayed with random times and lose coherency. Blending with random time delays or phase shifts is referred to as temporal blending in this thesis. Temporal blending shifts the blending noise across and along traces. 

Second, one can make use of spatial incoherency: Instead of blending sources in an organized spatial pattern one could randomly pick sources and blend them. This means the sub-diagonal elements of $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma ^H}$ are spread across the $\mathbf{\Gamma \Gamma ^H}$ matrix, which means that each column of the data matrix $\mathbf{P}$ is shifted by a different lag to the left or right. Thus, the columns of the data matrix $\mathbf{P}$ are not shifted coherently across traces, and a noise filter can reduce the blending noise. But the columns of the data matrix $\mathbf{P}$ are not shifted along traces in time direction.

%In practice of marine acquisition the spatial spread of the sources is limited, whereas random time delays between blended sources can easily be performed. Therefore, a spatial 
Comparing temporal and spatial incoherent acquisition one realizes that the temporal incoherent acquisition shifts the data across and along traces, while the spatial incoherent acquisition only shifts the data across traces. This suggests that temporal incoherent acquisition yields more incoherent blending noise than spatial incoherent acquisition, and therefore gives a better deblending result. This could be confirmed by comparing deblending quality factors of acquisition designs with different incoherency types. 

Ideally one combines temporal and spatial incoherent acquisition: If in the case of temporal incoherent acquisition the maximum allowed phase shift is large the traces of the blending noise are sufficiently spread in time direction to destroy their coherency. However, if the the maximum allowed phase shift is small the traces of the blending noise might still be coherent to a certain extent. In such a case the spatial incoherency can improve the pseudo-deblended result. Only spatially incoherent acquisition is strongly limited by the area over which the blended sources can be distributed in a marine acquisition. Therefore, it is rather considered as a support for temporal incoherent acquisition, but it is not sufficiently powerful to stand alone.

In short, this thesis suggests to acquire blended data with temporally and spatially incoherent blending patterns.

\section{Extension to 3D} \label{sec:MahdadMethod3d}

This thesis suggests to blend crossline sources, i.e. in combination with the movement of the seismic vessel one effectively blends sources in 3D.

Mahdad's deblending method is designed for 2D blended data. In principle, each step of the method can be applied to 3D data. Thus, I will extend Mahdad's deblending method to 3D and demonstrate its performance.

First, the data sorting will be modified such that the blended 3D data can be described with the forward model of \citet{Berkhout1982} (see section \ref{sec:Ch-Theory-Operator}). Second, the $f$-$k$-filter will be extended to remove noise in crossline and inline direction. The presented data sorting will allow to maintain all other steps of Mahdad's deblending algorithm unchanged.

\subsection{Data Sorting} \label{sec:Ch-Theory-3dExtension-DataSorting}

\subsubsection*{Data Matrix}

In 3D acquisition the sources and receivers are distributed on a 2D surface. Thus, their locations are defined by their crossline and inline positions. Each data point which is measured by a source receiver pair at a specific time is therefore constraint by 5 coordinates: Time $t$, receiver crossline and inline position ($x_r$, $in_r$), and source crossline and inline position ($x_s$, $in_s$).

Before applying the Mahdad deblending method the 5D data array will be reorganized in a 2D data matrix according to \citet{Delphi-Format}. For this data sorting a 1D Fourier transform with respect to time is performed and a frequency slice is selected. This reduces the data array from 5 to 4 dimensions. 

The 4D data array is sorted in a 2D matrix data matrix, $\mathbf{P}$, with as many rows as receivers and as many columns as sources. Assume there are $Ns_x$ sources per crossline. The sources of the first crossline are assigned to the first $Ns_x$ columns of the data matrix, the sources of the second crossline are assigned to the next $Ns_x$ columns of the data matrix, etc. The cross- and inline receivers are sorted in the rows of the data matrix in analogy. This is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:Ch-Theory-DelphiFormat}. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Plots/DelphiFormat}
	\caption{Illustration of the data matrix $\mathbf{P}$ for 3D data \citep{Delphi-Format}. $in_r$ and $in_s$ represent the inline receiver and source positions. $x_r$ and $x_s$ represent the crossline receiver and source positions. Each row refers to a 3D common receiver gather and each column to a 3D common shot gather. A sub-matrix with fixed receiver and source inline positions ($in_r$, $in_s$) is equivalent to a data matrix for 2D acquisition.}

\end{figure}


\subsubsection*{Blending matrix}

As described in section \ref{sec:BlendingMatrix} each row of the blending matrix, $\mathbf{\Gamma}$, captures one source. For extension to 3D the sources of the first crossline are saved in the top $Ns_x$ rows of the blending matrix, followed by the sources of the second crossline etc. This framework allows to blend any source combination independent of the cross- and inline positions of the involved sources.

With the new data and blending matrix sorting one can already apply the 2D Mahdad method to the 3D data.

\todo[inline]{Insert a figure to illustrate this!}

\subsection{3D FKK Filter} \label{sec:Ch-Theory-3dExtension-FKK}

For a 2D $f$-$k$-spectrum the minimum (physical) velocity of the subsurface, $v_{min}$, determines the maximum unaliased wavenumber, $k_{max}$,  for a given frequency, $f$,

\begin{equation}
	k_{max} = \frac{f}{v_{min}}.
	\label{eq_Ch-Theory-MaxWavenmber}
\end{equation} 

For each frequency, $f$, wavenumbers above $k_{max}$ are removed which results in a 2D signal cone.

For 3D data one obtains the $f$-$k$-$k$-spectrum by applying a n-dimensional Fourier transform to the 5D data array. Next, as Mahdad's deblending method is applied to common receiver gathers one picks a single receiver, i.e constant cross- and inline receiver number. This leaves a 2D matrix, which captures the cross- and inline wavenumbers ($k_x$, $k_in$). Again the maximum wavenumber is determined by equation \ref{eq_Ch-Theory-MaxWavenmber}. The total wavenumber, $k_{T}$,

\begin{equation}
	k_{T} = \sqrt{k_x^2 + k_{in}^2},
	\label{eq:Ch-Theory-TotalWavenumber}
\end{equation}

must be smaller than the maximum wavenumber, $k_{max}$. Hence the signal "cone" is defined by a circle. This is repeated for each frequency component, such that the overall $f$-$k$-$k$-mask is a 3D cone. Finally, this mask is computed for each receiver gather.

Once the mask is built for a 5D data array it can either be applied to filter a 5D data array, or the mask is sorted to 2D according to section \ref{sec:Ch-Theory-3dExtension-DataSorting} and applied to the $f$-$k$-$k$-spectrum of the data matrix.

\todo[inline]{Show plots to illustrate the difference between fk and fkk mask. Maybe add a plot of the same data as in the part about 3d extension of the blending matrix but with a 3d fkk filter.}

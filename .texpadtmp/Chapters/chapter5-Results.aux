\@writefile{tdo}{\contentsline {todo}{For the conclusion/discussion of these results: \\ Say that a high degree of incoherency is required for successful deblending, but it is not useful as a control factor of the deblending performance. Instead the maximum firing time delay allows to fine tune the quality factor and might be suitable to fine tune a trade off between deblending quality and acquisition time.\\ One can also say that the spatial incoherency performs poorly because its degree of incoherency is simply too low.}{33}{section*.46}}
